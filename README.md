## Twirlip using Pointrel20141201 by Paul Fernhout

This version of Twirlip is essentially a dynamic wiki system.

It uses Pointrel20141201 on NodeJS as a backend to store files in JSON content envelopes.
That server code and instructions for running it are in the "server" directory (essentially, just "node TwirlipServer.js").

To bootstrap more sophisticated pages, start at:
http://localhost:8080/simple_editor_for_content.html

That page is linked from the default index.html page.
A few example resource files are included, mostly just some test text files and a couple free images from NASA.

The license for the base code is MIT licensed.
The resource files may potentially be under other licenses in any expanding system.
